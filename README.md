# Thornless
[Thornless](https://thornless.weredev.com) ([https://thornless.weredev.com](https://thornless.weredev.com)) is a work-in-progress side project to help with generating random names for tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder.  The goal is to eventually grow this to generate shops and towns and other useful stuff.

## Code Structure
This is a pretty straight-forward n-Tier architecture with a few unit-tests.  The backend code is pretty standard.  The frontend code is a work in progress as I tinker with various designs and structures.
